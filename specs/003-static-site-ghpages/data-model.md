# Data Model

This feature produces a static site and does not introduce runtime data models or persistent storage.

- Entities: None (static-only)
- Validation: N/A
- State transitions: N/A

Notes: If future iterations add dynamic features (comments, user data, etc.), this document should be expanded with entities, relationships, and validation rules.
