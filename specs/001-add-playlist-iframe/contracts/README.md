# Contracts: Play YouTube Playlist via Iframe

This feature is frontend-only for the MVP and does not expose a backend API. Therefore there are no OpenAPI contracts for this iteration.

Possible future contracts (not part of MVP):
- POST /api/resolve-playlist — server-side validation or metadata fetch using YouTube Data API
- GET /api/playlists/{id}/metadata — return playlist title, count, thumbnails (requires YouTube Data API)

If a backend is added later, add OpenAPI specs in this directory.
