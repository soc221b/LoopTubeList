**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

**Evidence**: Measurement & Validation Plan included in the spec ("Measurement & Validation Plan" section) and test-plan at specs/001-spaced-repetition-playlist/checklists/test-plan.md. Execution artifacts (JSON reports) will be stored under reports/ and referenced here after test execution.
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

**Validation summary**: 15 of 15 checklist items currently marked complete. The Measurement & Validation Plan and test-plan are included in the spec; execution artifacts (reports/*.json) will be produced during validation runs to prove thresholds are met.
