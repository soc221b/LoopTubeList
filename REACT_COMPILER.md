React Compiler - Notes and setup

Source: https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler

Summary
- The React Compiler is an experimental compiler and transform for React that can statically optimize component code, remove unnecessary runtime, and enable new compile-time features.

What to read
- Start with the official guide: https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler
- Follow the bundler-specific instructions in that guide for Vite, Webpack, or other toolchains.

How to proceed in this repository
1. Read the official guide linked above to determine whether the React Compiler is appropriate for this project (it's experimental).
2. If proceeding, follow the bundler-specific steps in the guide. For Vite-based projects, the guide shows how to enable the compiler via the recommended plugin or configuration.
3. Prefer incremental changes: try enabling the compiler in a branch, run the test/build, and check for regressions.

Notes
- This file does not make code changes; it documents the official guide and a safe migration approach.

If you want, I can attempt to enable the React Compiler here (modify vite.config or relevant bundler config) — confirm and specify which bundler/plugin to target (Vite, Webpack, etc.).
